# Supabase Setup Guide for Image Storage

## Issue
Images are not being saved to Supabase storage because the environment variables are not properly configured.

## Current Error
```
TypeError: Invalid URL
input: 'your-supabase-url/'
```

This indicates that the `.env` file is using placeholder values instead of actual Supabase credentials.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
4. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **service_role secret key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### 2. Update Your .env File

Create or update the `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your actual Supabase credentials:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...your-actual-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...your-actual-service-role-key

# Other configurations
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/money-tracker
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here
```

### 3. Verify Storage Bucket Setup

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. You should see a bucket named `transaction-attachments`
3. If it doesn't exist, it will be created automatically when you upload the first image

### 4. Test the Connection

Run the test script to verify your Supabase connection:

```bash
cd backend
node test-supabase-connection.js
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Successfully connected to Supabase Storage
ðŸ“¦ Available buckets: [transaction-attachments, profile-images]
âœ… transaction-attachments bucket exists
ðŸŽ‰ Supabase connection test passed!
```

### 5. Restart Your Backend Server

After updating the `.env` file, restart your backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid URL"
- Check that your `SUPABASE_URL` is correct and starts with `https://`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

### Error: "Invalid JWT"
- Verify your `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are correct
- Make sure you copied the full key without truncation

### Error: "Bucket not found"
- The bucket will be created automatically on first upload
- Check your Supabase project has storage enabled

### Images still not showing
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the transaction record has the correct Supabase URL in the `attachment` field
3. Check that the Supabase bucket is public (it should be set to public automatically)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Upload**: When you upload an image with a transaction, it should be stored in Supabase storage
2. **Display**: The image should display immediately in Transaction Details
3. **Persistence**: After page refresh, the image should still be visible
4. **Storage**: You should see the uploaded files in your Supabase storage dashboard

## File Structure in Supabase Storage

```
transaction-attachments/
â”œâ”€â”€ {userId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {transactionId}/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {uuid}.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {uuid}.png
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {uuid}.pdf
```

This organization helps keep files organized by user and transaction for easy management.
